MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM - TESTING DOCUMENTATION
===================================================

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the testing approach
and methodology used in the Movie Recommendation System.

INPUT FILE GENERATION
=====================

Input files were generated using a combination of manual creation and AI assistance:

1. Sample Movies File (sample_movies.txt)
   - Generated by: AI Assistant (Claude)
   - Content: 30 movies across 6 genres (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi, Romance)
   - Format: movie_genre|movie_id|movie_name
   - Purpose: Comprehensive test data covering all major genres

2. Sample Ratings File (sample_ratings.txt)
   - Generated by: AI Assistant (Claude)
   - Content: Ratings from 5 users across all movies
   - Format: movie_name|rating|user_id
   - Purpose: Realistic rating distribution for testing all features

3. Test Data Files (in test_movie_recommender.py)
   - Generated by: AI Assistant (Claude)
   - Content: Smaller, focused datasets for specific test scenarios
   - Purpose: Unit testing and edge case validation

4. Malformed Data Files
   - Generated by: AI Assistant (Claude)
   - Content: Intentionally corrupted data to test error handling
   - Purpose: Validation of robust error handling capabilities

INCORPORATING ISSUES IN INPUT FOR CORRECTNESS TESTING
====================================================

The test suite incorporates various data issues to ensure robust error handling:

1. Malformed Line Testing
   - Missing fields: "Action|1" (missing movie name)
   - Extra fields: "Comedy|4|The Hangover (2009)|extra_field"
   - Empty lines: Blank lines in input files
   - Purpose: Test graceful handling of invalid data formats

2. Invalid Rating Testing
   - Non-numeric ratings: "invalid_rating", "abc", "N/A"
   - Out-of-range ratings: "-1.0", "6.0", "10.0"
   - Purpose: Validate rating range enforcement (0-5)

3. Duplicate Rating Testing
   - Same user rating same movie multiple times
   - Purpose: Test duplicate detection and prevention

4. Empty File Testing
   - Completely empty input files
   - Purpose: Test graceful handling of no data scenarios

5. Non-existent File Testing
   - Attempting to load files that don't exist
   - Purpose: Test file existence validation

6. Case Sensitivity Testing
   - Mixed case genres: "Action", "action", "ACTION"
   - Purpose: Validate case-insensitive genre matching

7. Tie-Breaking Testing
   - Movies with identical average ratings
   - Genres with identical average ratings
   - Purpose: Test alphabetical tie-breaking behavior

ENSURING GOOD DISTRIBUTION OF INPUT DATA
=========================================

The test data was designed to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. Genre Distribution
   - 6 different genres represented
   - Each genre has multiple movies (3-5 movies per genre)
   - Balanced representation across all major movie categories

2. Rating Distribution
   - Ratings span the full valid range (0-5)
   - Multiple ratings per movie (2-5 ratings per movie)
   - Realistic rating patterns (higher ratings for critically acclaimed films)

3. User Distribution
   - 5 different users with varying preferences
   - Each user rates multiple movies across different genres
   - Users have different genre preferences for testing recommendations

4. Edge Case Coverage
   - Movies with only one rating
   - Movies with many ratings
   - Users who rate only one genre
   - Users who rate across multiple genres

5. Data Quality Variations
   - Some movies with high ratings (4.5+)
   - Some movies with low ratings (3.0-)
   - Mixed rating patterns to test ranking algorithms

6. Recommendation Testing Data
   - Users with clear genre preferences
   - Unrated movies in users' preferred genres
   - Multiple users to test different recommendation scenarios

TEST COVERAGE ANALYSIS
======================

The comprehensive test suite covers:

1. Basic Functionality Tests (6 test cases)
   - Data loading validation
   - Top movies ranking
   - Genre-specific movie ranking
   - Genre popularity ranking
   - User preference analysis
   - Movie recommendations

2. Edge Case Tests (4 test scenarios)
   - Empty file handling
   - Malformed data handling
   - Non-existent file handling
   - Invalid user handling

3. Tie-Breaking Tests (2 test scenarios)
   - Movie ranking ties
   - Genre ranking ties

4. Data Validation Tests (2 test scenarios)
   - Invalid rating filtering
   - Duplicate rating handling

5. Case Sensitivity Tests (1 test scenario)
   - Genre case-insensitive matching

TOTAL: 15 distinct test scenarios covering all major functionality and edge cases.

TEST EXECUTION RESULTS
======================

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:

✓ Robust error handling for malformed input
✓ Proper data validation and sanitization
✓ Correct ranking algorithms with tie-breaking
✓ Case-insensitive genre matching
✓ Comprehensive recommendation system
✓ Graceful handling of edge cases
✓ Proper file I/O operations
✓ Memory management and cleanup

The test suite provides confidence that the Movie Recommendation System
handles real-world data scenarios correctly and provides reliable
recommendations to users.

TEST DATA STATISTICS
===================

Sample Movies File:
- Total movies: 30
- Genres: 6 (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi, Romance)
- Movies per genre: 5 each

Sample Ratings File:
- Total ratings: 89
- Users: 5
- Movies with ratings: 30
- Average ratings per movie: 2.97
- Rating range: 3.4 to 4.9 (average ratings)

This distribution ensures comprehensive testing of all system features
while maintaining realistic data patterns that would be expected in
a production movie recommendation system.
